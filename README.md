# üè∑ Cenovka

This simple utility app is intended solely for my mother. üòÜ

She's running a grocery store in Slovakia, and needs to print pricetags for the produce. She's also using her iPad to do this job, with a printer that does not support landscape mode through AirPrint, so I had to circumvent the problem by rotating the Print view. Yeah, I know, I'm a genius. ü§ì

## Motivation and Technical Background

As a harcore [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) fan, I wanted to try out [React](https://reactjs.org) for a very simple app, so here it is, me dipping my toes into Lake React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
